My dear computer,

I want site with three pages: home, customers and about.
In home page I want jumbotron with title: "This application is written in human language!", text: "Human to describe app, machine to write code!", button url: "customers".
Please create one collection: customers.
In customers collection I want three fields: name, address and e-mail.
In customers page I want CRUD for customers collection.
In about page I want text: "This application is written in human language using Meteor Kitchen, code generator for Meteor".

That's it, please create this application for me.

Thank you.
Petar
